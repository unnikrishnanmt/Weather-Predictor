# 🌤️ Weather Forecast using Pollution Data

This project predicts weather conditions based on pollution levels using a trained machine learning model. It is built with Streamlit and provides an interactive UI for predictions.

---

## 📝 Features

* Predicts weather metric from 12 pollution parameters (SO₂, NO₂, CO, etc.)
* Built with Streamlit and Python
* Includes pollution info, effects, and precautions
* Visuals added using Lottie animations

---

## 📁 Files Included

* `Frntend_WP.py`: Frontend Streamlit app
* `Backend_WP.py`: Backend (same logic as frontend)
* `ModelRegr.pkl`: Pre-trained ML model
* `data/`: Dataset file (upload separately)
* `screenshots/`: UI images of the project

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install streamlit streamlit-lottie
   ```

2. Run the app:

   ```
   streamlit run Frntend_WP.py
   ```

---

## 📊 Input Parameters

* SO₂, CO, NO, NO₂, NOx, NH₃, O₃
* Wind Speed, Direction
* Humidity, Solar Radiation, Temperature

---

## 📷 Screenshots

> Add screenshots inside `/screenshots` and link here (optional).

---

## 📦 Future Scope

* Add model explainability
* Deploy on cloud
