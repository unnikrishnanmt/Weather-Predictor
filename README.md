#This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts weather-related metrics using air pollution and meteorological data through a trained regression model. It features an interactive user interface where users can input pollutant levels (such as SO₂, CO, NO₂, etc.) and weather parameters (like wind speed, humidity, and temperature) to generate real-time predictions. The app also includes animated visuals and informative sections that explain the causes, effects, and prevention of air pollution, making it both educational and functional. Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Lottie animations, this tool aims to raise awareness while applying data science for environmental insights.
